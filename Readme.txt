This Project aims at visualizing the states that suffer most number of road accidents as a ratio to its population.
The India map on the left is coloured from light to dark as a ratio of State Population to Road Accidents Occurence in those states.
On the right, there are two options. On selection of first option, appears an interactive bar chart that tells the various parameters of People injured and killed in Road Accidents in Indian Metro Cities.
The second option shows an interactive pie chart that tells the percentage of deaths caused by various motor vehicles.

The main aim of this experiment was to understand and implement the working of d3.js ( Javascript library for Visualization) and also
to make use of Open Data i.e the data made freely available by Indian Government.
